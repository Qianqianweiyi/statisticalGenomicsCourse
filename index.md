### Course Description
High throughput omics studies generate ever larger datasets and, as a consequence, complex data interpretation challenges. This course focuses on the statistical concepts involved in preprocessing, quantification and differential analysis of high throughput omics data. Moreover, more advanced experimental designs and blocking will also be introduced. The core focus will be on shotgun proteomics and next generation sequencing. The course will rely exclusively on free and userfriendly opensource tools in R/Bioconductor. The course will provide a solid basis for beginners, but will also bring new perspectives to those already familiar with standard data interpretation procedures in proteomics and NGS.

### Target Audience
This course is oriented towards biologists and bioinformaticians with a particular interest in differential analysis for quantitative 'omics.
