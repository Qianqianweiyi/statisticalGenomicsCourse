### Course Description
High throughput statOmics studies generate ever larger datasets and, as a consequence, complex data interpretation challenges. This course focuses on the statistical concepts involved in preprocessing, quantification and differential analysis of high throughput omics data. Moreover, more advanced experimental designs and blocking will also be introduced. The core focus will be on shotgun proteomics and next generation sequencing. The course will rely exclusively on free and userfriendly opensource tools in R/Bioconductor. The course will provide a solid basis for beginners, but will also bring new perspectives to those already familiar with standard data interpretation procedures in proteomics and NGS.

Students can sharpen their background knowledge on Mass Spectrometry, Proteomics & Bioinformatics for Proteomics

### Target Audience
This course is oriented towards biologists and bioinformaticians with a particular interest in differential analysis for quantitative 'omics.

### Prerequisites
The prerequisites for the Statistical Genomics course are the successful completion of a basic course of statistics that covers topics on data exploration and descriptive statistics, statistical modeling, and inference: linear models, confidence intervals, t-tests, F-tests, anova, chi-squared test.

The basis concepts may be revisited in the free e-book Practical Regression and Anova using R of J. Faraway. The book and additional material is freely available on
http://www.maths.bath.ac.uk/~jjf23/book/â€‹

- Brief introduction to R: appendix C
- Linear models: Chapter 1-3, 7, 8.1-8.2, 12
- Anova: Chapter 16.1-16.2
